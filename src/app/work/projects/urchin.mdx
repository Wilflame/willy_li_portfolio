## Project Overview
[cite_start]I designed and built a smartphone-controlled robot for cliff diving safety that collects real-time water depth, pressure, temperature, and photo data via Wi-Fi using a direct IP address connection[cite: 39, 40].

## Technical Systems

### Buoyancy Engineering
[cite_start]I engineered a syringe-based buoyancy system using 3D-printed parts, a DC gear motor with encoder, and a gear mechanism to enable smooth depth control of the robot[cite: 41].

### Waterproof Fabrication
[cite_start]The waterproof, disassemblable casing was created by vacuum-forming PETG sheets around a PLA-printed mold[cite: 42]. [cite_start]I utilized O-rings, marine weld-level epoxy, and clamped two half-shells together using side fixtures[cite: 43].

### Electronics & Integration
[cite_start]The system integrates an ESP32 camera module, voltage regulator, barometric pressure sensor, Wi-Fi antenna, and a 4xAA battery pack into a compact, durable housing[cite: 45].
