## Project Overview

This Vine Robot Housing was designed and fabricated at Hawkes Research Lab, UCSB (Sept 2024 – Jan 2025) to expand and retract the vine. The housing integrates band-sealed rubber caps and a 10-inch diameter acrylic cast, engineered to withstand 4 psi of internal pressure, with laser-cut acrylic plates and a 50 lb-inch DC motor system for bi-directional motion control.

## Technical Systems

### Housing Design & Fabrication

Designed and fabricated a Vine Robot Housing to expand and retract the vine using SolidWorks, integrating band-sealed rubber caps and a 10-inch diameter acrylic cast, engineered to withstand 4 psi of internal pressure.

### Laser-Cut Acrylic Components

Utilized laser cutting to produce custom acrylic plates with precise dimensions, through cuts, and engravings for mounting.

### CAD & Assembly Integration

Developed CAD models and created assembly files to ensure accurate alignment and seamless integration of components, including motor, shaft couplers, bearings, and fixtures.

### Motor System & Control

Integrated, wired, soldered, and programmed a 50 lb-inch DC motor system with a motor driver, control buttons, and power source for seamless bi-directional motion control. Soldering was used to ensure secure electrical connections, and an Arduino was programmed to optimize motor speed and retraction dynamics based on variable spool radius and torque.
